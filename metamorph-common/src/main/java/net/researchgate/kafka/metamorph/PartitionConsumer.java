/**
 * A Kafka consumer interface for consumption of a topic partition
 * <p>
 *     It allows the discovery of available partitions of a given topic and the ability to bind to exactly one topic
 *     partition to consume data from it. The interface allows full control over the offset but also allows the
 *     underlying implementation to handle offset control autonomously while iterating over the records.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     This interface is heavily inspired by the new unified consumer interface introduced within Kafka 0.9.0 but is
 *     backwards compatible to older Kafka version since it relies on its own data representations. Also it allows
 *     only a subset of operations (e.g. only possible to consume one partition per consumer instance) which simplifies
 *     the concrete implementation in older Kafka versions.
 * </p>
